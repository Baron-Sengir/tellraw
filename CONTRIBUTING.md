## Pull Request Policy

If you want to submit a pull request, please observe the following guidelines:

- Make sure your pull request isn't a duplicate
- Make sure your pull request uses proper indentation. If you don't know what proper indenting is or how to do it, please indicate this in your pull request.
- Likewise, please use proper spacing. For example, please don't put spaces between an HTML property and value. (i.e. do **not** do `<span class = "coolSpan">`, instead do `<span class="coolSpan">`. Again, please indicate if you don't know how to do proper spacing.
- If your going to do something major, like rewrite the entire page in another programming language or whatnot, ask me beforehand if you can, because if your just doing it with a goal of  getting a pull request, and I decline it, it may be lots of wasted work.
- If your doing languages, please submit the JSON condensed (i.e. 1 line, like it is right now). Please **omit** all untranslated strings (for example, if `gui.button` doesn't have a translation in French, don't leave the french translation for `gui.button` as the english translation, omit it entirely.
